# Auto-Refresh-Wifi-Hotspot-for-Tailscale
Python script
Uses MyPublicWifi.exe to route internet to share wifi with a truenas server running tailscale - so we can share wifi internet connection and more, Checks for wifi disconnection and if the tailscale node is actually alive online

Key note: must give API key, not auth key.
Must run as admin or the exe app cant start unattended. Search and download the exe yourself. 
the mypublicwifi app must be set to auto start hotspot, ect.
Idealy much run at boot. And no human can click the yes to admin button. So it must be setup as a scheduled task. Ask AI for help.
